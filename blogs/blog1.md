
## Thoughts on *Innovation Insight for Microservices*, from Gartner 

### Background

My interest in computer science and really computers as a whole
came from my dad, who has been a software engineer since the late
'80s. One of the things he absolutely drilled into my head was
to never buy into 'buzzwords'. For a long time I thought that
distributed systems and the like were just another buzzword
that people were throwing around in order to make their resume
seem more impressive. This report has defined microservice
architecture, with little to no uncertainty, to be one of the most efficient application architectures out
there *when it is needed*. Gartner brings up a list of pre-requisites that
every business should consider before transitioning to MSA, and constantly
stresses that one of MSAs biggest drawbacks is the added complexity and need for
new roles. I have experienced this firsthand on a personal project I worked on last
year for a small community.

`Technical Agility: The ability to quickly adapt or integrate current
technologies with newer, different, disruptive, expansive, or
convergent technologies.` - [Kevin Fogarty](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2582993/technical-agility.html#:~:text=Technical%20agility%20is%20the%20ability,disruptive%2C%20expansive%20or%20convergent%20technologies.)


### What is Agility?

When I read the Gartner report for the first time, I did not really
understand what they were referencing when they mentioned application or
technical agility. I had a little intuition as to what it was just from 
the english definition of the word, but the actual technical definition was
foreign to me. So, after a little bit of googling, I found the above definition
that cleared my confusion up. To me, agility is the ability for an application 
or applications to quickly adapt to changing business needs or environments. It
makes sense that the most popular MSA products in the world are those that operate 
on either enormous global scale (Amazon, Netflix) or work in industries that are constantly
adapting to consumer needs (Pivotal, Microsoft). Those things are not exclusive either. 
I think that at least a proficiency will be almost a requirement for anyone working with
large company infrastructure. It will likely be that global services and enterprises alike
will be transitioning to MSA to support their scalability and agility requirements, meaning
proficiency with this relatively new technology will be white-hot.

### My Experience with MSA

After reading this report, I have realized that a personal project that I worked on last year
for a small community was actually at its core a fleet of microservices. Without going into 
too much detail, ther project involved creating, running, and managing tournaments. There is more
to it than that, but it's a good working definition. The project ended up failing miserably,
and for many of the reasons outlined in the report- I was and am not experienced enough
with MSA DevOps practices, the project was too small, I was not prepared to adopt unfamiliar designs,
etc. I didn't understand at the time why the project was so incredibly difficult, but I am glad
to know that it was not a lack of effort from me but rather an overestimation of my own 
abilities. I plan on reviving the project after this class gives me the basics of the tools I
will need in order to make it a success.
